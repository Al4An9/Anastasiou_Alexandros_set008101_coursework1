			<p id="text">In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. 
				An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. 
				In common parlance, "cipher" is synonymous with "code," as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.
				<br>
				Codes generally substitute different length strings of characters in the output, while ciphers generally substitute the same number of characters as are input. 
				There are exceptions and some cipher systems may use slightly more, or fewer, characters when output versus the number that were input.
				<br>
				Codes operated by substituting according to a large codebook which linked a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase. 
				For example, "UQJHSE" could be the code for "Proceed to the following coordinates." When using a cipher the original information is known as plaintext, and the encrypted form as ciphertext. 
				The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it.
				<br>
				The operation of a cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a key (or, in traditional NSA parlance, a cryptovariable). 
				The encrypting procedure is varied depending on the key, which changes the detailed operation of the algorithm. 
				A key must be selected before using a cipher to encrypt a message. Without knowledge of the key, it should be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext.

			<h2> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13" target="_blank">Rot13 Cipher</a></h2>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13" target="_blank"><img class="image2" src="/images/Rot13ExampleTable.png"></a>
			<p id="text">ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. 
				<br>
				ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome.
				Because there are 26 letters (2×13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. 
				<br>
				The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.

			<h2> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank">Caesar Cipher</a></h2>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank"><img class="image2" src="/images/Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of3.png"></a>	
			<p id="text">In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
				It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
				For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
				<br>
				The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. 
				As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communication security.
