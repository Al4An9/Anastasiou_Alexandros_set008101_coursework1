			<p id="text"> In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot. 
			Encryption does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. 
			In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating ciphertext that can be read only if decrypted. 
			For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. 
			It is in principle possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. 
			An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.</p>
